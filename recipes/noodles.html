    <h3>The Dragon Warrior's favorite soup</h3>
        <p>Can you guess the secret ingredient? It's not what you think!</p>
        <p>"You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup. And then you
            will fulfill
            your destiny and take over the restaurant just as I took it over from my father, who took it over from his
            father, who
            won it from a friend in a game of mahjong!" -Mr. Ping</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

                2 carrots, peeled and diced
            </li>
            <li>
                ¼ of an onion, diced
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                3 stalks of celery, diced
            </li>
            <li>
                Pinch of salt
            </li>
            <li>
                Pinch of pepper
            </li>
            <li>
                1 ½ tbsp of canola oil
            </li>
            <li>
                6 cups of chicken broth
            </li>
            <li>
                ½ cup of water
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tbsp of soy sauce
            </li>
            <li>
                2 packets of egg noodles
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare all your ingredients beforehand to have a smoother cooking experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dice the carrots and celery according to your desired size.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dice the onion and mince the garlic into small pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine the oil, onion, garlic, carrot and celery in a large pot and cook until the vegetables are soft.
                Add in salt and
                pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you smell the fragrance of the onion and garlic, add the chicken stock and water in, and bring the
                mixture to a
                boil. I waited for around 10 minutes for the mixture to come to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the soy sauce and noodles into the mix and cook for about 5 to 10 minutes more until the noodles are
                cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately. This step is crucial to having good noodles because if you leave it out for an
                extended period of
                time, they might absorb all the soup and lose its al <em>dente</em> texture.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <em>
            <p>"Wait, wait... it's just plain old noodle soup? You don't add some kind of special sauce or something?"
